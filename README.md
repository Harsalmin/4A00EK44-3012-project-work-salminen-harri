Project work for course 4A00EK44-3012 introduction to programming

This project is about making a simple contact information database that you 
can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on, using Java and 
a text file as database.

## Motivation

Motivation for this project was primarily for because the project work was 
mandatory, but these kind of applications are the very basic kind of 
functionality that employers are looking for, so this is a really good 
practice project when getting ready to apply to jobs or making up a 
protfolio.
